# testing_practice_jest

## About
This project was for the Testing Practice assignment in the Todin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Javascript Course. See full details here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-practice

The goal of this project was to get familiar using Jest and a test-first work flow. As such it entailed writing tests for a collection of functions, then writing the code for those tests -- doing the minimal amount to get the code to pass.
